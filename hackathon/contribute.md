# Fixing an issue for MDAnalysis

With over 400 issues on the [core library](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues) 
and [User Guide](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/UserGuide/issues), we 
are always looking for new and old contributors to help enhance and 
maintain MDAnalysis.


## Getting started

In order to contribute to MDAnalysis, you will need to set up a
development environment, make a fork of the MDAnalysis codebase
and then contribute the code back using a 
[Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Our [User Guide](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/) has a handy 
[contributors guide](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/contributing_code.html#adding-code-to-mda) which you can
follow for all the information you need to achieve this. Feel free
to ask any members of the team for help if you encounter any issues
getting started.


## Choose an issue

We have plenty of issues available for you to work on in our Issue Trackers for the
[core library](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues) 
or [User Guide](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/UserGuide/issues). 
For first time contributors, we encourage
you to look at our list of [easy bugs](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ADifficulty-easy) 
to fix. Have a chat with us,
to see which one would suit you best! When you find something, please
let us know in the issue that you are working on it so that other
attendees do not work on the same thing!

Our recommended pick is the [doctest MEGA-issue](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/3925) 
which involves
fixing our documentation so that code examples are self-contained
and should run on their own if you try them out! Here multiple
attendees can work on this issue, just let us know which files you
are planning to work on.

## Make a Pull Request!

Once you have made the suitable code change to fix the issue,
[open a Pull Request](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/contributing_code.html#adding-code-to-mda) 
and we will review your code change
and work with you towards getting your contribution merged.

This can sometimes be a slow process, especially when the
code change is large and there are many Pull Requests. If you
wish to help, you are welcome to review other people's Pull Requests
by leaving comments on their code with any changes you would
suggest!
