# Hackathon

To wrap up our two-day workshop, we will be holding a half-day **hackathon**, from 
14:00-17:45 on June 25th. 
This is an opportunity for you to put the skills you've just learnt to work on solving 
a problem using MDAnalysis! We encourage you to begin work on an MDAKit of your own - 
but you're free to work on anything related to MDAnalysis. See [below](#what-can-I-work-on)
for more information.

Start thinking about what you'd like to do early. We also encourage you to work in 
groups to tackle the same or similar issues together. A white board will be available 
throughout the workshop for gathering ideas and organising groups.

Your MDAnalysis tutors will be on hand to help out with any questions or issues you 
may have.

***Joining remotely?*** You can still join in on the hackathon! We'll have MDAnalysis 
personnel keeping an eye online to help out with questions asked on our 
[Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/sAKgZZnPv4) or 
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/discussions).

### Showcase
We'll end the hackathon with a short showcase - this is your opportunity to for 
you/your group to show of the work you did (no matter how small!). If you want to 
present, add a slide to the shared Google slides presentation. A link will
be provided beforehand.

## What can I work on?

### 1. Build an MDAKit!
Have an idea for a useful tool that uses MDAnalysis? Start turning it into an MDAKit today!

Don't have your own idea but still want to work on an MDAKit? You could join forces 
someone else to help bring their idea to life. We also have some ideas for MDAKits 
[listed here](./mdakitideas.md).

### 2. Contribute to MDAnalysis!
We're always looking for new contributors to the core 
[MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis) library and our 
[User Guide](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/UserGuide). You could use this 
hackathon to fix one of our many issues, or maybe 
add a fun new enhancement. See more information [here](./contribute.md).

### 3. Work on your own problem!
Have a problem in your own work you want to solve with MDAnaylsis (e.g. a particular 
analysis you want to perform?), you can also use this session to work on that!
