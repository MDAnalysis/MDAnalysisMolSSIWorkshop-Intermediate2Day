# Python Packaging
The material for the `python packaging` lessons is adapted from the [MolSSI Python Package Setup Lessons](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/01-package-setup.html).
The lessons will cover
- The use of the [MDAnalysis CookieCutter](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/cookiecutter-mdakit)
- The file structures produced by the `cookiecutter`.
- How to develop and use a python package utilizing the `cookiecutter` output.

We will utilize the [MDAnalysis CookieCutter](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/cookiecutter-mdakit) to create a repository and fill it with code from the MDAnalysis `mdgeomkit` repository developed for the workshop.

The code can be found at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdgeomkit
