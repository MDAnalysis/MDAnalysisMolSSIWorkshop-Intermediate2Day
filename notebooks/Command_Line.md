# Introduction to the Bash Shell
The material for the `command line` lessons is adapted from the [MolSSI Introduction to the Command Line lessons](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/00-command-line-basics.html).
The lessons will cover
- The `command line` interface to your computer.
- How to view and move around your file system with the `command line`.
- How to create and work with files from the `command line`

We will utilize the [MDAnalysis CookieCutter](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/cookiecutter-mdakit) to create a repository and fill it with code from the MDAnalysis `mdgeomkit` repository developed for the workshop.

The code can be found at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdgeomkit
