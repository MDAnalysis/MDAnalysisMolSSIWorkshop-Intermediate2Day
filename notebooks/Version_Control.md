# Git and GitHub
The material for the `git` lessons is adapted from the [MolSSI git and GitHub Lessons](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/00-git-and-github.html).
The lessons will cover the use of
- the `git` version control software.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/), a remote hosting resource for `git` repositories.
- Utilizing `GitHub` for collaboration on software projects, using a [Periodic Table Repository](https://github.com/MolSSI-Education/periodic-table), produced by MolSSI

We will utilize the [MDAnalysis CookieCutter](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/cookiecutter-mdakit) to create a repository and fill it with code from the MDAnalysis `mdgeomkit` repository developed for the workshop.

The code can be found at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdgeomkit
