# Documentation
The material for the `documentation` lessons is adapted from the [MolSSI Package Documentation Lessons](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/10-documentation.html).
The lessons will cover
- Types of documentation
- Documenting your code through `docstrings`.
- Creating documentation using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and [readthedocs](https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.org)

We will utilize the [MDAnalysis CookieCutter](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/cookiecutter-mdakit) to create a repository and fill it with code from the MDAnalysis `mdgeomkit` repository developed for the workshop.

The code can be found at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdgeomkit
