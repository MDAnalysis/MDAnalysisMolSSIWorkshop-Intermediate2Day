# Python Testing
The material for the `pytest` lessons is adapted from the [MolSSI Python Testing lessons](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/08-testing.html).
The lessons will cover the use of
- `pytest` to write tests for functions.
- `pytest` features such as fixtures and parameterization.
- The coverage of the code based on written tests.

We will utilize the [MDAnalysis CookieCutter](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/cookiecutter-mdakit) to create a repository and fill it with code from the MDAnalysis `mdgeomkit` repository developed for the workshop.

The code can be found at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdgeomkit
