# Reporting

We all follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/conduct).

The Code of Conduct applies in all MDAnalysis spaces, in particular to
*both* the *in-person* and the *online* portions of this workshop (as
well as to all communications on Discord and our Discussion forums).


## Code of Conduct violation

You can always report a violation of the Code of Conduct via the form
